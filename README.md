# Code_Example
By Nick Garrett

A collection of code samples for various languages Nicholas Garrett has written.  
This list of programs and samples has, and will expand when a particularly "demonstrative" program or script is finished. In no way is this an assembly of all the programs I have written, only an assemblage of particular examples that perform something interesting or do, in my opinion, demonstrate my ability in programming of the relavent language.
