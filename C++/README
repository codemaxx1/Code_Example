Counting sort function in C++

Create a zeroed-out array of unsigned longs with range and size defined at the top of the program (arrayRange and arraySize respectively). 
On an array of maximum size 2^32-1 of unsigned long types, count the number of occurances for number n in the range of values and store them into a frequency count array.
Then, iterate through the terms of the frequency count array, up to the term coinciding withthe maximum character appearing in the unsorted array range.
Put the number of terms for each index in the frequency count array into the unsorted array.
Now, the "unsorted" array should contain all the same values as it had before, though they are now sorted from min-max.
