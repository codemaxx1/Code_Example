greatest common denominator calculator


This program takes 2 user inputs and calcuates the greatest common demonimator of the two.
It incorperates a function which ensures that a devision by zero error does not occur, this function doubles as a zero and negative number filter for user input, as both of these inputs cause errors in the system.  


To use: run code, a prompt will ask for the first integer.  Please, no zero's, negatives, or decimals.  
While there is an error checker for the first two, there is no system checking that the number entered is a whole number.
After entering your integers, the program will determine the smallest of the two, and take a copy of the number checking if it is a devisor of both integers.  
If it is, then that integer will be returned in an output to the user.  
Otherwise, it will subtract one from that integer, and check it again.  
Recursively operating until eventually, it returns an answer... or an error message. (preferably the prior)
