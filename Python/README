This program is a virtual assistant designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi. (a small, single-board, ARM-processor, development board)
On initializing the program, a GTTs (Google Text to Speech) generated voice will provide a brief explanation of the project--named Terrandelle. 
By speaking the voice command "help", a small menu and explanation of various commands will be spoken by the system.

Some functions of this program are: 
                return (vocally) the current time, 
                various responses and greetings dependant on the time of day, 
                reading a newsfeed, 
                send / check for emails,
                connection to Wikipedia for definition and explanation of questions,
                read the weather report for a city.
