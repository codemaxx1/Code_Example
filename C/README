*Text output reading "CHECK STATUS <function>:" conveys which function the output originates from


sendReply.c       
        on running the program, the user will be asked to provide text input
               
        all the printf outputs are color-coded for their respective funtion to help me with debugging.
        
        when you enter an input (or not) and press enter, that input will be edited to have the string "::REPLY" appended to the back of it.
        this is then sent into a different pipe as a signal to the parent function to send the next sting
        
        when this edited string is recieved by the parent process, the process starts again.

        
        
timeStamp.c
        On running the program, the user wil be prompted to provide an input
                
        when you enter an input (or not) and press enter, that input will be edited to have the string ":" appended to the back of it (this helps with ease in tokenizeing the string).
        this is then sent into a different pipe as a signal to the parent function to send the next sting
        
        the text output will appear in various colours, with each color coinciding to a specific function.
        
        when this edited string is recieved by the parent process, the process starts again.
